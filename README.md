# comp_proj2
For this project there are four different cpp files and one hpp file. 
In the header file there are all the functions used in the different problems (cpp files). There we can see the creation matrix function, the finder of the max value, the rotator and the jacobi eigensolver. 
The file "Problem2.cpp" has the code for problem 2, "prob4.cpp" has problem 4 and file "Problem5" for the fifth.
Note that as the armadillo library is used for this project the ejecution command written in the terminal should be g++ FILENAME.cpp -o FILENAME -larmadillo.
