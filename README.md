For this project there is a src folder wich contains four different cpp files and a include folder which contains one hpp file. 
In the header file there are all the functions used in the different problems (cpp files). There we can see the creation matrix function, the finder of the max value, the rotator and the jacobi eigensolver.

Note that as the armadillo library is used for this project the ejecution command written in the terminal should be g++ FILENAME.cpp -o FILENAME -larmadillo.
